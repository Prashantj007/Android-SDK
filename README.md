# Introduction

Shufti Pro has designed this Verification API document for its customers that have signed up for our next-generation service pack. This document will explain various kinds of verification services included in this service pack, how they are provided and what kind of data is required from our clients to perform these verifications successfully.

**Shufti Pro’s AI & HI hybrid technology ensures 99.6% accurate results and quickest response time.**

Shufti Pro’s API supports verification with and without OCR.

## Verification
In order to get verified, customers will have themselves verified through their mobile phones. They will do it through the merchant’s mobile application. Merchant will collect the information and send us the data for verification. The Merchant shall provide us with the proofs(Videos). We will not collect them directly from the user.


* ### With OCR
During verification with OCR, an end-user or Shufti Pro customer simply provides identity documents to Shufti Pro for verification. The smart system of Shufti Pro extracts credentials automatically from the provided documents and verify them as well. Consult [This Document](verification-with-ocr) to understand the technical requirements to perform verification with OCR.
    
* ### Without OCR
During verification without OCR, Shufti Pro customers or end-user is required to provide not only verification data but also provide proof of that data as well in the form of identity documents. Consult [This Document](verification-without-ocr) to understand the technical requirements to perform verification without OCR.
